SQL and Git
=================
Introduction: This repository records my learning, history, use in real projects and internships, and personal feelings about git operation and SOL language.
Git
-----------------
To understand GitHub, we must first have an understanding of Git. Git is an open-source version control system. Git is similar to other version control systemsâ€”Subversion, CVS, and Mercurial to name a few.

So, Git is a version control system, but what does that mean? When developers create something (an app, for example), they make constant changes to the code, releasing new versions up to and after the first official (non-beta) release.

## Installing Git
  1. https://git-scm.com/downloads
  2. Github Desktop(Recommend)
      Using easily, Fetch origin, easy commit, push origin
      Great interface
    
## Git commands
  1.  Git status -- Check your Git status
      Git add filename -- Add a file for staging
      Git add * -- Add all the files for the staging
      Git commit -a -- Commit all the files for staging
      Git push -- Push all the staged changes to remote (origin) master
      Git pull -- Pull any new updates from remote (origin) master to local branch
  2. Using Github Desktop can easy deal with these commands.
  
  However, These two ways have their advantages and disadvantages. Using toghter. It's a great tools in study and intern.
